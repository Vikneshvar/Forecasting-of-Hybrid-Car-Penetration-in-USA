# Forecasting-of-Hybrid-Car-Penetration-in-USA

Forecasts of hybrid car penetration in the U.S. market from 2007 through
2016 for each scenario you develop, along with a justification and explanation for your
forecasts. (In applying the Bass model, note that market penetration data for the four analog
products mentioned in the case, namely, ABS, EFI, Solar, and Diesel cars, were all reckoned in
terms of the percentage of the target market that adopted the product. Thus the maximum
market potential can at most be equal to 100).
