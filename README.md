# Forecasting-of-Hybrid-Car-Penetration-in-USA

Forecasts of hybrid car penetration in the U.S. market from 2007 through
2016 for each scenario you develop, along with a justification and explanation for your
forecasts. (In applying the Bass model, note that market penetration data for the four analog
products mentioned in the case, namely, ABS, EFI, Solar, and Diesel cars, were all reckoned in
terms of the percentage of the target market that adopted the product. Thus the maximum
market potential can at most be equal to 100).

The major characteristics of current hybrid car owners are:

● High level of education.
● Higher income than the average new buyer—approximately $100,000 a year versus
$85,000 a year for the average buyer.
● Willing to pay more for an environmentally friendly (or “green”) product.
● Want to do something to help reduce vehicle pollution.
● More pessimistic about the future of fuel prices than the average person.

Bass Parameters
Total Market Potential - Number of potential customers before period 1
Total market potential = # customers in target market * % aware * % with access * % with
strong intent

Number of households in 2006 - 114 million

Number of households earning nearly 85000 - 25%
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_in_the_United_States
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_middle_class_in_the_United_States

Therefore number of customers in target market is 25% of 114 million = 28,500,000
We are not doing any market survey, so our assumptions on other factors are
% aware = 0.5 (50% are aware of hybrid cars)
% access =0.4 (40% have access)
% strong intent = 0.4
% medium intent = 0.8

Based on our assumptions,
Market potential = 28,500,000 * 0.5 * 0.4 * (0.4*+(0.5*0.8) = 4,560,000 = 4.56 Million

Market Penetration - Number of cars already existing in the market :

Total number of actual adopters before period 1 (who already own hybrid cards)

Total Market Penetration = 20149+3174 = 23323

Market Growth Rate
http://www.multpl.com/united-states- population/table
0.96% ( As per Population growth rate in 2006)

Market Price Elasticity
0.5 (Assumption based on analog products)

Advertising Coefficient
1.5% (Population has good knowledge of hybrid cars because people of this category are highly
educated)

Price Coefficient
3% (Assumption)

Price and Advertising Data

Advertising
● Total for 10 years
● Initially, for 4 years advertising can increase by $0.15, and stable for 4 years, then
increase again for 3 years by $0.20

Pricing
● Decrease by 5% every year for first 5 years, then decrease by 10% for remaining 5 years
